# Bird-Sound-Classification-on-Edge-Device
Bird Sound Classification on Edge Device using Edge Impulse and machine learning. The system can detect and identify specific bird species from audio input using a USB microphone. The classifier is optimized to run efficiently on the Raspberry Pi 5 with 4GB RAM, making it an excellent example of edge AI implementation for wildlife monitoring.
